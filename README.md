   # Introduction to Wireframing

## What is Wireframing?

**Wireframing** is the process of creating a visual blueprint or skeletal outline of a digital product â€” such as a website, app, or software interface.  
It focuses on the layout, structure, and placement of key elements without including final design details like colors or images.  

A wireframe helps designers and stakeholders visualize how users will interact with the product early in the design process.

## Importance of Wireframing in the Design Process

- **Clarity and Communication:** Wireframes act as a visual guide, helping teams and clients understand how a product will function.  
- **Early Feedback:** They allow stakeholders to give input and make changes before costly development begins.  
- **User Experience Focus:** By simplifying visuals, designers can focus purely on usability and flow.  
- **Efficient Planning:** Wireframes help define navigation paths, information hierarchy, and user journeys clearly.  
- **Foundation for Prototyping:** They serve as the first step before turning the design into a clickable prototype or final UI.

### Summary
Wireframing bridges the gap between an idea and the actual product. It ensures that every page or screen has a clear purpose and provides a roadmap for developers and designers to follow.
