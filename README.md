# Wireframing

## Introduction
Wireframing is the process of creating a visual guide that represents the skeletal framework of a digital product, such as a website or application. It focuses on layout, structure, and functionality rather than design elements like colors or images.  
Wireframes help designers, developers, and stakeholders understand the product’s structure and how users will interact with it before any actual design or coding begins.

Wireframes are important because they:
- Clarify the structure and flow of content.
- Allow early testing of ideas and usability.
- Facilitate communication between design and development teams.
- Help identify potential design issues before full-scale development.

## Key Elements of a Wireframe

### 1. **Layout Structure**
The layout structure defines how the components of a page are arranged. It determines where headers, footers, sidebars, and content areas are positioned.

**Example:**  
In a hotel booking page, the layout might have a header at the top for navigation links, a main section showing available rooms, and a footer displaying contact information.  
This ensures that users can easily identify the primary areas of interaction.

### 2. **Navigation**
Navigation elements guide users through the application or website. This includes menus, tabs, buttons, and links that connect different sections or pages.

**Example:**  
A navigation bar with links to “Home,” “Rooms,” “Booking,” and “Contact” helps users quickly find the information they need, improving the overall user experience.

### 3. **Content Placement**
Content placement defines where text, images, videos, and other information will be displayed. It ensures that users see the most important information first.

**Example:**  
On the booking page, placing the search bar and date selector at the top helps users immediately begin searching for rooms without scrolling down.

### 4. **Functionality**
Functionality represents interactive components that perform specific actions — such as forms, buttons, dropdowns, and booking confirmation modals.

**Example:**  
A “Book Now” button allows users to initiate the booking process, while form fields collect information like check-in date, check-out date, and number of guests.  
These elements show how the user will interact with the interface.
